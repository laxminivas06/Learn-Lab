        "description": "A Python programming laboratory, or lab, provides a practical, hands-on learning environment for students to develop programming skills in Python. It focuses on applying theoretical concepts to solve real-world problems, often using interactive experiments and structured learning activities. These labs often utilize virtual environments like those provided by Virtual Labs or tools like Jupyter Notebooks, which allow students to write, test, and debug Python code. "
